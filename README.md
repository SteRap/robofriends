<h2>Explanation</h2>
ROBOFRIENDS is a small and simple React App which I developed in order to start practicing with React and API. The app is built on the API provided by Robohash https://robohash.org. 
The app includes a searching feature that allows users to filter among their robofriends by typing the robots' names.
